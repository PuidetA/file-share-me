"""
1. File Handling

calculateFileHash(filePath): Generates a unique hash (like SHA-1) to identify the file on the network.
divideFileIntoChunks(filePath, chunkSize): Splits the file into smaller chunks for efficient transfer and resuming downloads.


2. User Interface (UI)

onDragEnter(): Handles when a user drags a file into the designated area.
onDragLeave(): Handles when the dragged file leaves the drop area.
onDrop(filePath): Triggered when the file is dropped. Initiates calculateFileHash() and prepares for sharing.
displayFileList(): Updates the UI with the list of files available for download.
shareFileList(fileList): Triggered when displayFileList() method from another peer requests a list of files.
updateDownloadProgress(fileHash, progress): Visually displays download progress of a file.


3. Peer Discovery and Connection

connectToSharingNetwork(*clientAddresses): Establishes a connection to the file sharing network.
registerWithNetwork(fileHash, clientID): Informs the network that this client is sharing a particular file.
sharePeerList(fileHash): Retrieves a list of healthy peers with the desired file.
connectToPeer(peerAddress, peerPort): Establishes a direct TCP connection with another peer.


4. File Transfer

requestFileChunk(peerID, fileHash, chunkIndex): Sends a request to a peer for a specific chunk of a file.
sendFileChunk(peerID, fileHash, chunkIndex, chunkData): Responds to a chunk request by sending the actual file data.
receiveFileChunk(peerID, fileHash, chunkIndex, chunkData): Function to receive a chunk, verify its integrity, and store it.


5. Download/Upload Management

initiateDownload(fileHash): After approving download of a file, begins the download process by fetching the peer list of healthy peers that have the file and starting connections.
prioritizePeers(): Selects the most suitable peers based on factors like download speed and availability of chunks.
reassembleFile(fileHash): Once all chunks are downloaded, reassembles the file.

"""
Interaction Example: Downloading a File

1. Request and receive file list: User requests the network for current list. displayFileList() queries the network.
2. UI Update: displayFileList() shows search results to the user.
3. Download Initiation: User approves file download. initiateDownload(fileHash) starts.
4. Peer Retrieval: sharePeerList() gets peers.
5. Connection and Requests: connectToPeer() establishes connections, then requestFileChunk() is sent to multiple peers.
6. Chunk Transfer: Peers use sendFileChunk() to respond. The client uses receiveFileChunk() to get data.
7. Optimization: prioritizePeers() runs to prefer better sources.
8. Reassembly: reassembleFile() combines chunks into the complete file.
